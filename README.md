# DNSR (DNS Router)

> [!NOTE]
> **Major Update (4.0)**: 
> - Now uses DNS-based routing instead of transparent proxy
> - Better performance and reliability, especially on routers
> - If you need SOCKS5 proxy support, use old [v3 release](https://github.com/Jipok/dpi-bypass-proxy/releases/tag/3.0.0)

A simple yet powerful tool that automatically routes your traffic through VPN for blocked websites while keeping everything else direct. Just download, run, and enjoy unrestricted internet access! Perfect for both personal computers and **routers**.

## Key Features

- ‚ú® **Simple to Use**: Download and run - that's it!
- üåê **Universal**: Works on both Linux PCs and routers (OpenWrt)
- üöÄ **Smart Routing**: Only routes specified websites through VPN, keeping other traffic direct
- ‚ö° Lightweight: Minimal resource usage with maximum efficiency
- üîß Built-in WireGuard support (can automatically set up from config)
- üõ°Ô∏è Optional domain blocking
- üîÑ Auto-cleanup on exit
- üìù Support for OpenVPN, WireGuard, or any other network interface

## Quick Start (2 Minutes Setup)

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Jipok/dpi-bypass-proxy/releases/latest) or build from source
2. Prepare your domain lists:
   ```bash
   # For proxy list (recommended)
   wget https://github.com/1andrevich/Re-filter-lists/raw/refs/heads/main/domains_all.lst -O proxy.lst
   
   # For block list (optional)
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/gambling/hosts -O blocks.lst
   ```

3. Run with either a WireGuard config or existing interface:
   ```bash
   # Using WireGuard config (automatic setup)
   sudo ./dnsr ~/my-wireguard.conf
   
   # Or using any existing network interface
   sudo ./dnsr --interface tun0    # OpenVPN interface
   sudo ./dnsr --interface wg0     # WireGuard interface
   ```

That's it! DNSR automatically handles everything else.

## OpenWrt Setup Guide

1. First, check your router's architecture to download the correct binary:
```bash
uname -m    # or
opkg print-architecture
```

2. Download the appropriate binary for your architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/Jipok/dpi-bypass-proxy/releases/latest).

3. The DNSR requires the NFT queue kernel module. Install it using:
```bash
opkg update
opkg install kmod-nft-queue
```

4. Start dnsr

5. Once DNSR creates its network interface, you'll need to configure a new firewall zone:

### Command Line Options

```
Usage: dnsr [--interface INTERFACE] [--proxy-list PROXY-LIST] [--block-list BLOCK-LIST] 
           [--silent] [--verbose] [--no-clear] [WG-CONFIG]

Positional arguments:
  WG-CONFIG             Path to WireGuard configuration file (optional)

Options:
  --interface, -i      Use existing network interface (OpenVPN, WireGuard, etc.)
  --proxy-list         Domains to route through specified interface [default: proxy.lst]
  --block-list         Domains to block [default: blocks.lst]
  --preset-ips         File with IP addresses to proxy immediately, without waiting for DNS resolution
  --silent, -s         Don't show when new routes are added
  --verbose, -v        Enable verbose output
  --persistent, -p     Keep WireGuard interface (if created) and routes after exit
  --help, -h           Show this help message
  --version            Show version

Multiple proxy/block/ips lists can be specified using semicolon (;)
Example: proxy1.lst;proxy2.lst;proxy3.lst
```

## How It Works

1. The tool monitors DNS responses using NFQUEUE
2. When a domain from the proxy list is resolved:
   - Creates specific routes for the resolved IP addresses
   - Directs matching traffic through specified interface
3. All other traffic continues to use the default route
4. Domains in the block list are dropped
